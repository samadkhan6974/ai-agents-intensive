# Day 1 – Introduction to AI Agents\n\nNotes will go here as I learn about core concepts and architecture.
### What I Learned on Day 1
- What AI agents are  
- How they differ from normal chatbots  
- The 5 core components: Models, Tools, Orchestration, Memory, and Evaluation

### My Understanding
AI agents are systems that can think, decide, and act using large language models (LLMs).  
They go beyond chatbots because they can use tools, remember past context, and take real actions — like searching, scheduling, or generating code.
