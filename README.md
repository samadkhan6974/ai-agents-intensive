 ## âœ… Progress Tracker

**Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Agents**  
âœ”ï¸ Completed: Set up environment, created first agent loop, and pushed project to GitHub.


Next: Day 2 â€“ Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP

 ---
Day 2: Added AI Agent with Tools and Tool Registry

## ğŸ§© Day 2 â€“ AI Agent with Tools

### ğŸ” What I built
I created an AI Agent capable of using multiple tools (Calculator + Translator).  
It can perform arithmetic operations and translate simple phrases dynamically via a simulated Tool Registry â€” inspired by MCP (Model Context Protocol).

### ğŸ§  Concepts Learned
- How AI Agents access and use tools.
- Using a **Tool Registry** for dynamic discovery.
- Basic multi-tool system architecture.

### â–¶ï¸ How to Run
```bash
python agent_with_tools.py 6f8267c (Day 2: Added AI Agent with Tools and Tool Registry)
## í·  Day 3 - AI Agent with Memory
- Implemented conversation memory using Python and JSON.
- The agent now remembers previous chats and summarizes them.
- Explored basic persistence using memory.json.
