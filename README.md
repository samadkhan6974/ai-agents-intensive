# í·  Day 4 â€“ AI Agent Tools

In Day 4, I built an AI Agent that can use external tools like:
- íµ’ Time Tool â€” tells the current time
- â• Calculator Tool â€” solves expressions
- í´ Wikipedia Tool â€” searches and summarizes topics
- í²¬ Personality & Memory â€” remembers context and responds naturally
- í¾™ï¸ (Optional) Voice Input/Output â€” speaks and listens

### íº€ Tech Used
Python, JSON, Wikipedia API, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition

### í²¡ Outcome
The agent can now think, respond, and use real-world tools interactively.
